# Deep-Learning-Training-GUI
This repository allows you to get started with a gui based training a Deep Learning model with no configuration needed! Set your labeled dataset and start the training right away and monitor it with TensorBoard.

# Getting started
### Prerequisites

Coming soon.

### Dataset Folder Structure
The following is an example of how a dataset should be structured. Before you train a deep learning model, put all your dataset into datasets directory.

```
├──datasets/
    ├──example_dataset/
        ├── images
        │   ├── img_1.jpg/png
        │   └── img_2.jpg/png
        ├── labels
        │   ├── json
        │   │   ├── img_1.json
        │   │   └── img_2.json
        │   └── pascal
        │       ├── img_1.xml
        │       └── img_2.xml
        

```
